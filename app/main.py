"""Unified CRM Agent application — all 12 modules + home index dashboard.

All agent routers are registered here.  Each agent exposes its own endpoint
prefix so existing HTML frontends require zero URL changes.

v2.4.0 — Added EmailAgent module (info@agentorc.ca — SMTP/IMAP + LangGraph).
  • Endpoint: POST /email-chat
  • Health:   GET  /email-health
  • Frontend: email-mgmt.html
  • SMTP: mail.agentorc.ca:465 (SSL)  IMAP: mail.agentorc.ca:993 (SSL)

v2.3.0 — Added Auth module (Conscestra CRM Authentication).
  • Direct DB routing — no AI agent, no LangGraph AI nodes.
  • Endpoints: POST /auth/signup, /auth/signin, /auth/signout,
               /auth/change-password, /auth/password-reset/request,
               /auth/password-reset/confirm, /auth/verify-email
  • Health:   GET  /auth-health
  • Frontend: auth.html

v2.2.0 — Added Store module (CRM Commerce View).
  • Direct SP routing — no AI agent, no LangGraph AI nodes.
  • Endpoint: POST /store-chat
  • Health:   GET  /store-health
  • Frontend: store-home.html
