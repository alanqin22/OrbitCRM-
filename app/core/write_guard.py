"""In-agent write guard (security roadmap #3 — closes the NL-write gap).

The HTTP gate (auth_dep.require_data_access) classifies write-vs-read from the
*structured* `mode` in the request body, so a free-text command typed into the AI
bar ("create a lead", "delete invoice 5") slips through as a read. This guard sits
at the universal DB choke point — execute_sp() — and inspects the agent's RESOLVED
intent (the `p_mode`/`p_action` baked into the SQL by the sql_builder). That intent
exists only AFTER the agent has parsed the NL, so it catches what the HTTP layer
cannot.

Mechanism: require_data_access stamps the caller's role onto a request-scoped
ContextVar; execute_sp calls guard_query() before running any SQL. Outside a request
(role None = scheduler / agent-bus / system) it is a no-op, so background automation
is never blocked.
