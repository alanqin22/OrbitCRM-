"""Notification Triage — conscious orchestration of the alert backlog.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
Every DB change emits an event that fans out to ~12 agent service-account inboxes
(channel='agent_inbox') AND to the user (channel='in_app'). Nothing consumes or
*resolves* those rows, so "unread" grows without bound (≈7.8k and climbing). The
only control was running `sql/mark_old_notifications_read_8k.sql` by hand — a blunt
sweep that hides the count, discards genuinely-actionable signal, and refills the
next day.

WHAT THIS DOES (the Notifications/Orchestrator agent reading non-critical alerts
and taking positive action — digest + auto-read, instead of blanket-marking):

  Pass A — agent-inbox receipts.  An agent_inbox row is the agents' own mail. It is
    "resolved" once the agent has nothing left to do: the event_queue row is no
    longer pending, OR no Python handler subscribes to that event_type (it will
    never be actioned). Mark those read; leave the genuine bus worklist (pending +
    a registered handler) for the consumer.

  Pass B — informational digest.  In-app FYI events (`*.created`, `*.updated`,
    `account.updated`, `invoice_created`, `payment_created`, `invoice_paid`, …) get
    rolled up into ONE digest notification per recipient per day (counts preserved
    in metadata), then the originals are marked read. 642 "account updated" → 1.

  Pass C — stale-actionable cleanup.  In-app ACTIONABLE alerts (invoice.overdue,
    lead.scored) are re-validated against live entity state; if the invoice was
    paid / the lead converted-or-disqualified, the alert is resolved. Still-actionable
    alerts are LEFT unread — that is the legitimate human/agent worklist.

  Left untouched: fresh actionable alerts + CRITICAL (`supervisor.alert`). The
  dashboard "UNREAD ALERTS" then reflects real work (tens), not fan-out noise.

SAFETY / GOVERNANCE
-------------------
  • Opt-in: no-op unless NOTIF_TRIAGE_ENABLED=1.
  • Dry-run by default: computes and reports what WOULD change but writes nothing
    unless NOTIF_TRIAGE_APPLY=1 (mirrors AGENT_BUS_AUTOSEND).
  • Per-pass cap (NOTIF_TRIAGE_CAP) bounds a single run.
  • A digest is always created/updated in the SAME transaction that marks its
    originals read — visibility is never dropped without a rollup standing in.
  • Idempotent: re-running folds into the same per-recipient/day digest; already
    read rows are untouched.

CONFIG (env)
  NOTIF_TRIAGE_ENABLED   0     master on/off (scheduled tick is a no-op when 0)
  NOTIF_TRIAGE_APPLY     0     1 = actually write; else dry-run (report only)
  NOTIF_TRIAGE_CAP    5000     max rows touched per pass per run
